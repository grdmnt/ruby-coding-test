`/users/'` - Users list

# The task

1. Improve the existing code as much as possible.
2. Track of all the email addresses a user has had in its history and display it on the user page.

There is no need to make the html pretty. It's okay as it is now.
Feel free to alter database tables, add new gems and files. We expect the code to be production ready.
